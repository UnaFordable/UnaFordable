This is my first blog on GitHub. Thanks to the GitHub for dummies textbook by Sarah Guthals. Before. I could only work on my game on my mac book. Now, I can freely go from my mac book to my windows computer with no hassel (assuming I committed and merged properly). I in the mist of learning how to make a turn based rpg via online YouTube tutorials, which can only take me so far. I also have to draw up what kind of sprites I need for my game. I have a good friend who is willing to make music for my game when the need arises.

This isn't a full time project, just something I do during my free time. Thanks for reading!
